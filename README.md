# Laboratory Report
## Topic: Introduction to the Interface and Capabilities of Linux OS
### Objective:
To familiarize with the interfaces of Linux OS, gain practical skills in working within Linux environments and mobile OS, and learn the basic actions and settings while working in the system.

---

## Glossary of Terms
1. CLI Mode - Command Line Interface mode, which allows users to interact with the operating system by entering text commands.
2. GUI-based Terminal - A program that emulates a terminal within a graphical environment, allowing users to input commands and receive text output.
3. Virtual Terminal - A terminal that operates independently of the graphical interface, typically accessed through keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + F1).

---

## Preliminary Preparation Tasks
1. CLI Mode - A text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands.
2. GUI-based Terminal - A program that provides a graphical interface for entering commands, usually accessible from the system menu.
3. Virtual Terminal - A text interface available without a graphical environment, allowing users to execute commands.

## Procedure

### Working in Graphical Mode in Linux Family OS
#### Graphical Interface: Gnome
1. Structure of the User Workspace:
   - Main Menu: Access to applications, settings, and system functions.
   - Quick Access Panel: Quick access to frequently used applications and functions.
   - Search: A tool for quickly finding applications and files.
   - Access to New Workspaces: Ability to create and switch between multiple workspaces.

2. Launching Applications:
   - Through the Quick Launch Panel: Users can click on the application icon on the panel.
   - Through Menu Search: Entering the application name in the search field.
   - Through Launch Widget: Using a widget for quick access to applications.

3. Logging Out and Shutting Down in Linux:
   - Switching User to Root: Using the command su or sudo -i.

   - Rebooting the System: Using the command reboot or through the system menu.

### Working in the Mobile OS Environment
1. Main Menu: Includes access to all installed applications, settings, and phone functions.
2. Graphical Interface: Utilizes a touchscreen for navigation.
3. Settings Menu: Access to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sound, display, and other component settings.
4. Keyboard Shortcuts: Used for quick access to functions such as taking screenshots or opening menus.
5. Logging into the System and Shutting Down the Device: Typically involves entering a PIN or password, as well as options for shutting down or rebooting the device.
6. Battery Power Settings: Options for configuring power-saving modes, screen brightness, and background processes.

## Control Questions
1. Examples of Linux Server Applications:
   - Database Server: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
   - Mail Servers: Postfix, Sendmail.
   - File Sharing: Samba, FTP servers (vsftpd, ProFTPD).

2. Comparison of Shells:
   - Bourne Shell: The first shell with basic functionality.
   - C Shell: Additional features like command history.
   - Bourne Again Shell (Bash): An extended version of Bourne shell with script support.
   - tcsh: An enhanced version of C shell with additional features.
   - Korn Shell (Ksh): Combines features of Bourne and C shell.
   - zsh: A powerful shell with many customization options.

3. Package Manager: A tool for automating the installation, updating, and removal of software. Known package managers include APT (Debian, Ubuntu), YUM/DNF (Fedora, CentOS), and Pacman (Arch Linux).

4.Security Measures in Linux: Use of access rights, SELinux, AppArmor, firewalls (iptables, firewalld).

5. Relevance of Virtualization: Allows efficient resource utilization, isolates environments, and tests new configurations without risk to the main system.

6. Containerization: A technology that allows applications to run in isolated environments (containers), simplifying deployment and management.

7. Advantages/Disadvantages of Open Source Software:
   - Advantages: Free, modifiable, large community support.
   - Disadvantages: Potential support issues, lack of guarantees.

8. Number of Active Virtual Consoles: By default, there are 6 (tty1 - tty6). They can be accessed using keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6, and switching between them.

9. Virtual Console for Graphical Shell: Typically tty7 or tty8, where the graphical interface runs.

10. Multiple Logins in Linux with the Same Username: Possible but generally not recommended. Advantages include the ability to run parallel tasks, but conflicts over resources may arise.

## Conclusions
As a result of this laboratory work, practical experience was gained in working with both the graphical interface and command line in Linux OS. The main components of the workspace were explored, methods for launching applications were learned, and the specifics of working in a mobile OS environment were understood. Key terms and concepts related to Linux were studied, and answers to control questions confirmed knowledge of the system.
